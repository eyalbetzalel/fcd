 Fréchet Clip Distance Implementation for PyTorch. 
 
 The FID is a measure of similarity between two sets of images. In studies on the quality of samples of GANs, this measure has been found to correlate well with human judgments of visual quality. The Fréchet distance is calculated between two Gaussians fitted to feature representations of the Inception network.  
 We showed in our article that CLIP feature more suitable for this task under different datasets. 
 
 This code is based on *mseitzer* FID implementation that can be found [here](https://github.com/mseitzer/pytorch-fid)
